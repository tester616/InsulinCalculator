Download the project as .zip. Ready for import after extraction (tested with Android Studio).

NOTE: Since my computer for whatever genius reason refuses to create a complete .zip (by totally ignoring the .idea folder) when the source folder is selected, I had to select every folder & file inside of it to make it work. In other words you need to extract the .zip and put everything into a folder. This folder originally had the same name as the .zip itself.















































I swear I'm going to get an incomplete copy with Ctrl + C one of these days.
